# TruMate - Document Processing & Knowledge Extraction System

**Formal Specification and Disclosure**  
_All rights reserved_

## Overview

TruMate is a sophisticated AI system designed to ingest, analyze, and restructure any volume of written, visual, or data input into optimized, deduplicated, anonymized, and censored output that remains fully faithful to original intent, purpose, and contentâ€”without hallucination, bias, or negative effects of truncation.

## Purpose

To create a persistent, scalable system that can process documents and data while:
- Maintaining complete fidelity to original intent
- Eliminating hallucination and bias
- Handling unlimited input volumes through recursive analysis
- Providing structured, optimized output

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Input-Agnostic Parsing
- Accepts text documents, structured records, chats, images, diagrams, notes
- Language-model-guided parsing extracts full structure and content
- Multimodal data coherence across different input types

### 2. Purpose-Driven Extraction
- Deduces overall purpose from the corpus
- Flags and retains only segments aligned with inferred purpose
- Removes off-topic, repetitive, or misaligned content

### 3. Advanced Deduplication
- **Fully identical sentences:** Retain one, delete others
- **Near-identical content:** Represent as base + branch with delta stored
- **Sentence-level branching:** Efficient storage of variations

### 4. Neutrality Enforcement (Bias-Removal)
- All conclusions must be rooted in content
- No injected bias or distortion based on filters
- Strict inference enforcement - no hallucinated connections

### 5. Rewriting Engine
- Rewrites with exact same intent in more concise, effective form
- Supports censorship by pattern (e.g., profanity filtering)
- Intent-aligned category sentiment aggregation

### 6. Advanced Precision Features
- **Strict Inference Enforcement:** No hallucinated relationships
- **Intra-Document Logical Conflict Detection:** Flags contradictions
- **Autonomous Execution:** Runs without user hand-holding
- **Session Persistence:** Retains state for long-running analyses

## Key Technical Features

### Infinite Memory Emulation
The system is specifically engineered to be immune to truncation-induced degradation:
- Monitors its own memory boundaries
- Flags omissions automatically
- Performs multiple analysis passes as necessary
- No assumption that truncated input constitutes the whole story
- Recursive review built-in to mitigate context loss

### TRUCE Architecture
**TRUCE** = Total Recursive Understanding, Contextual Extraction
- Trustworthy, collaborative AI system
- Acts as a teammate guided by purpose, not indifference
- Emphasizes utility, reliability, and shared intent

   - Legal document processing
   - Research paper analysis
   - Technical specification extraction

2. **Knowledge Base Creation**
   - Multi-source information synthesis
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Purpose-aligned content organization

3. **Content Optimization**
   - Bias-free summarization
   - Intent-preserving rewriting
   - Structured data extraction

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Logical consistency checking
   - Completeness verification
   - Accuracy validation

## Technical Specifications
