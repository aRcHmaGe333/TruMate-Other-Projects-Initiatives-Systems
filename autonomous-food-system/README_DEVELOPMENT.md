docker build -t trumate-automation .
docker run -p 3000:3000 trumate-automation
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for rapid development and JavaScript ecosystem
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible recipe and ingredient schemas
- **Frontend**: React for responsive user interface
- **Testing**: Jest for comprehensive testing suite
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js for browser-compatible machine learning

### Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Each component is independently testable and replaceable
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling
- **Safety**: Multiple layers of safety checks and fail-safes
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for adding new capabilities
- **User-Centric**: Focus on practical value and ease of use
